# python_oop_project
As a team project, we were asked to look for a real world application of object oriented programming in python.

We set out to create a currency converter. The conversion was to be between cedis and dollars, euros, pounds and the chinese yen.

We first created the class and instantiated it. 

We then created methods for the cedi to dollar, cedi to pounds, euro and yen convertions

To make the program easy on the user we ask them to choose from a list of currencies to convert to.
